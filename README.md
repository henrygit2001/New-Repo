# Skiplagged-Website-To-Retrieve-Airline-Data

Edit: Unfortuantely, Skiplagged "blacklisted" public domains that is trying to retrieve data from it (including Heroku and any other public hosting domain). This can only be run in localhost.
If you want to run this, please download this to your localhost and run it from there. It will work!

My frontend/backend website that calls the Node-Skiplagged API to retrieve data for airline and then using that data to create a Discord webhook.
